# text-encyption-decryption

Encryption of plaintext using stream cipher Geffe generator and subsequent decryption The python scipt h3.py reads plaintext from the text file 'plaintext.txt' and encrypts using a key generated by stream cipher generator Geffe generator and writes the encrypted data into file 'newtext.txt' and then decrypts the encrypted text using the same key used in encryption to get the original plaintext back.
